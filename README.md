## üîÆ Future Plans

Some thing that is held by a college for college students I want it to be open source.

* I want to add secure chat feature
* A page where one can post items he is selling (good for my college)
* A page for College Events Notifications( I dont check my emails that often üòÖ )

Student features - (College would not like these)

- ü§ì A page where one can see anonymouse review of a course or  elevtive or prof. (helps student select additional courses)
- üí™ A flex page one can flex (gym , internships , ....)
- üòÖ ~~A page to access older question papers~~
- page for newbies (freshers) 
- üöÄ info about interns , sports facilities ....

It could make the students have a strong community.
Makes 


Well these might seem like a lot to have but its better to have as it saves one from a lot of spam mails.

Idk but may be in a new project ig.
